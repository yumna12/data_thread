        <p>*Our assumption for the sake of the deeper understanding between the correlation of two variables is that these two variables arre not affectted.</p>
        <p>Dollar index spiked while gold, oil and stock declined.</p>
        <h4> What implications does a spike in dollar price can have on gold, oil and stock market?</h4>
    
        <p>Assuming everything else, such as politics, interest rates and other factors international trade and foregin currencies stay constant, if the dollar increases in price, the following should occur.</p>
        <li>Gold will drop.</li>
        <ul> > IF the value of the dollar is high, an investor will require less  dollar to buy the same quantity of gold.</ul>
        <li>Stock market will decline.Expensive dollar will drive the foreign investor away.</li>
        <ul> > In the long run, the import will increase and exports will decrease.</ul>
    
        <li>Oil will decline because oil is mostly traded in US dollar. </li>
        <ul> > Expensive dollar will make the oil cheaper to buy.</ul>

    <h2>Trading:</h2>
    <p>First and foremost, Remember the market condition (Volatility, Average True Range, Renko trend setup).
    
    <p>On a regular market environment where the volatility and expected volatility is 
    Before entering a trade:</p>
        <ul>1. Which time range am I going to trade?</ul>
            <ul>a. This totally depends on the trade target. My personal trade target per trade is a minimum 2% net trade.</ul>
            <ul>b. Stop losses also depend on the volatility in the market. My reference for a stabilized market is 
            </ul>
            <p>As of 11AM EST, 10Y is catching bid, stocks are showing a downward trend. Oil is sinking  and gold is showing divergence. The current scenarios shows that the stocks will continue to move lower. Problem with the $1T repo market. The dealers cant use it because of regulations from OCC, the Fed and the FDIC etc. The policy is making it almost impossible to swap good grade bonds with reserves.

            <p>Feds are doing the best they can to readily push for more credit into the system to keep things afloat.</p>
            <p>Tools:</p>
            <ul>1. Treasury and MBS market (feds providing liquidity).</ul>
            <ul>a. They have reached a very high level of liquidity.</ul>
            <ul> b. If treasury and MBS doesn’t stabilize that will impact other markets (dominos effect).</ul>
    
            <p>Market measures of inflation declined.</p>
    <p>Inflation down but it's still not deflation</p>
    <p>The net effect of the virus is that inflation will move down a little bit more (it's not deflation)</p>
    <p>Purpose of asset purchases - supporting economy -> Normalizing market function.</p>
    <p>Timing: QE increase over coming months How long keeping things low.</p>
    <li>There is no monthly cap and weekly cap</li>
    <li>Buying at strong rates to restore market function</li>
    <li>$700B what is the frequency?</li>
    <p>Q: What is Fed watching for economic indicators?
    </p>
    <p>Fiscal policy</p>
    <ul> - Reach out directly to workers and industry</ul>
    <p>Broader fiscal stimulus</p>
    <ul> - Not sure and will be depended on the time</ul>
    <p>Indicators</p>
    <ul> - Treasury market functioning</ul>
    <ul> - Making the markets more liquid especially when they are in stress</ul>
    <ul> - Supporting the flow of credits</ul>
    <ul> - Economic data will follow the data on the spread of the virus (Economic data is lagged so not that important)</ul>
    <ul> - Spread of the virus and what path its going to take</ul>
    
    <p>Time horizon and how you are looking at this who corona virus situation
        Feds don’t have any clue and leaning on the experts</p>
    
        <p>Toolbox:</p>
        <ul>Feds have plenty of policies left</ul>
        <ul>1. Liquidity tool (market normalization)</ul>
        <ul>2. Interest rate cuts</ul>
        <ul>3. Fiscal policy plays a major role in downturn</ul>

            <p>My progress is slowly but surely syncing with my equity curve. The major progress in trading is coming with developing more confidence as I make more winning trades.</p>
            <p>The way I started out with more winning than losses was due to the following reasons:</p>
            <li>Stop making options day trades (costed me $25k worth of losses, not to mention the emotionally draining mindset that comes with it).</li>
            <li>Started learning more about the economic mechanism overall.  More specifically, I started to read on dollar, inflation, yield curve, behavioural economics, gold, oil and the bond market. I simultaneously started approaching the stock market to see why the price is moving the way it is.</li>
            <li>In order to accomplish winning trades, I cleaned out my list of individual stocks since my top down was not that great, and I chose SPY SP500ETF and its corresponding 3x leveraged ETFs URPO and SPXU.</li>
            <li>To understand the price action, I started paying attention to the yield curve, Gold, dollar, oil and US30 (DJIA).</li>
        <img src="image3.png">
    
        <li> This layout provided an excellent way of looking at the price actions simultaneously.</li>
        
        <li>Once I started becoming more familiar with the root cause of all these markets. And one can never be 100% certain of the price action but based on certain market conditions, one can gauge the price actions and once all the markets move, it confirms your theory. Basically, the trader is always lagging behind these price changes and making prediction of where the price will go from then on.</li>
    
        <li>This led me to create a trading strategy layout. Again, the strategy itself is not 100% buy and sell signal generation but it’s a flexible indicator of buying and sell entry points.</li>
    
        <li >One exception to buy and sell entry points is the hard risk limit. Based on market volatility, the limit lower end is 3%gross loss or 3%(multiplied with market volatility ratio) to avoid stop loss triggering in super volatile environment.</li>
        
    <img src="image4.png">
    
        <li>This is a famous day trading strategy call Lazy River on a 5 minute chart. I also use Think or Swim to confirm my trade direction if I am not certain.
    </li>
    
    <img src="image5.png">
    
    <p>Based on current progress. I conclude that I need to keep doing the following:</p>
    <p>1. Stick with my strategy (more refining required)</p>
    <li>Chart Analysis</li>
    <ul>i. Must write the conditions on the chart of what I would do if the price goes the opposite of my trade</ul>
    
    <ul>ii. Analyze chart on the Trading View site as well as mark then chart in PDF.</ul>

        <p >PreMarket:</p>
        <li>10Y note has dropped for the entire day yesterday. The yield seems stabilized and is above 1%.</li>
        <li>Markets has cratered, futures are limit down.</li>
        <li>Gold is losing its bid after a climb yesterday.</li>
        <li>WTI falling, which has caused caused the markets to lose confidence despite of all the positive news (Commercial Paper Funding, repo stimulus, payroll taxes, etc.) yesterday.</li>
    
        <p>Focusing on anti-debt assets would be the key to avoid hyper inflation.</p>
    
        <p>Too much downward pressure should cause a short term relief in the market.</p>
    
        <p>Trade1.</p>
        <p>Entered a position UPRO at market open. Was few damn minutes later because of work meeting and then a colleague kept asking about currency CADUSD correlation and why Canadian dollar is going down right now. Anyhow, after a brief time, the markets gained momentum in price action and I was above my 2% target. I entered a limit order at  a comfortable ask price, which should be fulfilled with another surge in price action. Totalled a 2.7% gain lasting for 15-20 minutes.</p>
        <p>Holding and waiting for the setup I like. Back to work!</p>
    
        <p>Trade2.</p>

        <p>Big swing since it was close to the end, my intention was to keep the position over night but the slight pump of close to 10% instigated closing my position before lower price consolidation. I exited and missed out on at least 40cents but still was one of the bigger trades.</p>

        <div class="container">
            
            <p>This is March 20, 2020 and the blog is how I'm going to trade and how am I looking at the price action so in the long run this is going to provide me some insight on how I was trading currently.</p>
    
            <p>Trade2.</p>
            <p>10Y yield cratering, gold going down, oil down from previous day high. Markets are falling as well from their overnight highs.</p>
    
            <p>Markets were very optimistic premarket (overnight). One of the main reasons for that was all the governments giving all their got in their tool crib to fix the issue. 
    
            <p> Markets are behaving bizarrely during intraday. Yield spiking didn’t lead to an increase but a decline in the stock price. This happened while oil was also catching bid. And gold was in the downward trajectory.</p>
    
            <p>Q: Why is the stock price falling in this situation?</p>
    
            <p> Entered a position UPRO at $22.33. first resistance in SPY is $238.49 But the RSI is not in the overbought yet. Price continues to climb with resistance.
            </p>
    
            <p>Selling target when SPY is in the range $239.5 and $239. $238.5 resistance is strong and the price is consolidating at this point. It is also worth noticing that the price is inside the river now.</p>
    
            <p>I will be exiting when the price hits the red ema.</p>
    
            <p>Resistance at $239. This could be major. Most trading occurred in this range during the day.</p>
    
            <p>Price is dropping after the test. Price still remains in the river.</p>
    
            <p>On the 10 year yield is dropping stock seems to be catching the bid gold is also catching bid and oils up.</p>
    
            <p>If the price retest Ehlers and then goes up then it will definitely hit the target otherwise I will have to figure out a way to get out and take my profit. RSI most likely will make a divergence around $239 or lower.</p>
    
            <p>A bigger pattern on lazy river seems to be conforming and if that's the case then we have more upward pressure than downward pressure my price target will definitely be achieved. This still may take some time. And in order to get what I want I should focus more on my strategy than my emotions because currently I think I am being emotional. After the retest at $235.53 and the spy is climbing again. Still looking for RSI diversions at one minute chart. We do have very good momentum so it might even cross that and hit my target limit.</p>
    
    
            <p>There seems to be some kind of problem with my Questrade IQ Edge the UPRO is not giving me any bid or ask price I'm not sure if my order is going to be accurate at the price target and here it looks like we do have an RSI divergence I think I'm going to get out at market price.I think at this point I'm going to take some risk because the five minute charge on that it looks like it's going to go up and it might take some time because price might come down and then go back up so I'm going to take my chances now. </p>
    
    
            <p>As concern currently is that the oil is topping out and seems like it's losing its bid.</p>
    
    
            <p>The price is currently hitting the resistance again the third time within the last 30 minutes and it seems like if the prices and break this point then we are definitely going to have a rehearsal otherwise we will hit the price target.</p>
    
    
            <p>Price target achieved I got out at $23.45 for a PRO and right after that the price declined and now it's hitting a support it might be a good point to enter another position but I'm still continuing to watch.</p>
    
            <p>TRADE 3 Looking for setup.</p>
            <p>Enter the position of $21.92 at 72 shares and the price plunged right after. I will be exiting the street at $21.80 and until then I'm just waiting for the consolidation and the price to go back up.
            </p>
    
            <p>Why am i holding this trade? </p>
    
            <p>I am currently 5% down and the market seems to be bothering out the 10 year yield seems to be dropping that was down oil is consolidating and I think this will decide whether the markets are going to go up or down and gold is also consolidating after losing some value.</p>
    
            <p>There's a sharp increase in price let me all the way to break even and now the price is make an RSI divergence now might be a good time to get out but if I hold and risk it then the price target is most likely achievable.</p>
            <p>RSI diversion signal was correct and the price is going down. There are no signs of consolidation but we are experiencing increased volatility.</p>
    
    
            <p>Questions coming from today's market move:</p>
    
            <p>Markets are trading more emotions than the actual data. That is what's increasing the volatility in the markets.</p>
            <p>IDEA:</p>
    
            <p>Good idea will be to write down the names of each of the important events that happened today or even the entire week based on all the articles that I'm reading.</p>
    
    
            <p>Overall my strategy is working. The problem is I have stopped following my daily routine.</p> 
            <p> At this point I will have to cut my losses and start again. Plan is to stick with the strategy. More wins than losses with losses minimized.</p>
